#Minimal Boilerplate
This is a small boilerplate that can be used for getting a project up and running quickly. It is intentionally small, to avoid including unnecessary files/code.
###What does it include?
Current third party additions are jQuery 1.11 and normalize.css v3. jQuery is used via a reference to the Google hosted library, but there is a local fallback in the event that something goes wrong.

It also has default html, CSS, and Javascript files, with a basic directory structure. The CSS file contains a selector for using "border-box" on all elements.
